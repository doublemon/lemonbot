A basic web scraper designed to look through Trial System reports on BlankMediaGames' Town of Salem game and fetch the role lists, for research/statistical purposes.

Currently the scraper is configured to only record Ranked role lists, this can be tweaked by the user.

Enquiries and/or complaints can be sent to [u/nowthatswack](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=nowthatswack) on Reddit.
